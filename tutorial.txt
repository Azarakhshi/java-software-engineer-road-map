Java core:
		about java (Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language.) :
			Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc. (swing, AWT)
			Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc. (Servlet, JSP, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, JSF)
			Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.
			Mobile
			Embedded System
			Smart Card
			Robotics
		Features of Java:
			Simple
			Object-Oriented
			Portable
			Platform independent
			Secured
			Robust
			Architecture neutral
			Interpreted
			High Performance
			Multithreaded
			Distributed
			Dynamic
		System.out.println();
		Java Variables (String, int, double, float, char, boolean), type variableName = value;
		Types of Variables (local variable, instance variable, static variable), (Primitive data(Cannot be null), Non-primitive data)
		Operators in Java
		What happens at compile time? java cocde -> compiler -> Byte code -> JVM -> OS
		Difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM:
			JVM: is an abstract machine and are available for many hardware and software platforms.
			JRE: is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. (set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime)
			JDK: is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. (contains JRE + development tools), (java, javac, jar, Javadoc)
		//comment
		Decision Making statements (if statements, switch statement)
		Loop statements (do while loop, while loop, for loop, for-each loop)
		Jump statements (break statement, continue statement)
	Big O Notation : describe the upper bound or worst-case scenario of the runtime complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size. 
	algorithm:
		Sorting algorithms:			
			Quick sort
			Merge sort
			Bubble sort
			Selection sort
			Insertion sort
		search algorithm:
			Binary search
			Breadth First Search (BFS) Algorithm
			Depth First Search (DFS) Algorithm
		Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm
		Lee Algorithm
	String (string pool, stringBuffer, Stringbuilder,... )
	Stack and Heap in java :
		The major difference between Stack memory and heap memory is that the stack is used to store the order of method execution and local variables while the heap memory stores the objects and it uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.
